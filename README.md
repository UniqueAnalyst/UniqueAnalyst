# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammed Abdulmalik

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently learning **Data Analytics** through **Vephla**, where I'm building a strong foundation in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Power BI, Python, Tableau and R for Analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling.

📊 I’m passionate about data — how it moves, how it’s shaped, and how it can be used to understand real-world behavior.

🧠 I enjoy exploring datasets, uncovering hidden patterns, and understanding the “why” behind the numbers. My curiosity drives me to keep learning, and I believe that data has the power to solve everyday problems in smart, impactful ways.

🔧 I'm currently focused on:
- Microsoft Excel for data analysis
- Microsoft Power BI and Tableau for data visualization
- Foundational statistics
- Data storytelling and visualization
- Real-life business use cases

🧱 I'm hardworking, self-driven, and always looking for opportunities to improve. Every day is a step forward in mastering the data world.
